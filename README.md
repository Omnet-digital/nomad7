Feel free to browse my coding project Wrath Outdoor ( listed under projects )- a hand coded website using html, CSS, GIMP and a small amount of back end sripting to make the contact forms work. I also embedded e-commerce functionality, launched the site for testing and managed to both rank on Google and even made some sales! The code is stored here on GitHub as I decided I wanted to code not run a shop - I learned lots and am now ready to learn alot more about back end scripting.
