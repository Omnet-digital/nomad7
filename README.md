Feel free to browse my coding project Wrath Outdoor ( listed under projects )- a hand coded website using html, CSS, GIMP and a small amount of back end sripting to make the contact forms work. I also embedded e-commerce functionality, launched the site for testing and managed to both rank on Google and even made some sales! A sample of the hand coding is stored here on GitHub. I removed the site from the open web as I decided I wanted to code not run a shop - I learned lots during this project and am now ready to learn alot more about back end scripting languages to create dynamic forms and website features such as a sign up . login page. 

I have included the ,index and .css file to Wrath Outdoor below 

The compete 20 page website still runs on my local drive alongside the image files etc - please let me know if you would like to see the full site :) See the code samples in GIT here :)
